# Open exercise
In this exercise you will use what you have learned in the course, but you will have to figure out things yourself.

In this exercise, we want to investigate whethere there are any specific transcription factors that seem to bind to the boundaries of topologically associating domains.

### Background
Topologically associating domains are regions of the genome with a high degree of “self-interaction”, meaning that areas of the DNA inside these domains are spatially close and often physically interact. Many of these domains are conserved across cell types and even species, and genes within domains are often involved in the same processes. 

Transcription factors, such as CTCF, are proteins that bind to specific locations in the genome, often with the purpose of regulating nearby genes. It is believed that CTCF has a tendency to bind to the boundaries of topologically associating domains, and that the binding of CTCF directly affects how these domains form and shape. In this task, we will use the following data sets to investigate whether CTCF seems to have a preference towards binding to the boundaries of topologically associating domains:


### Data
You will find all data you need in [this zip-file](data_files.zip). Download it and unzip it. The files are:
* domain_boundaries.bed: Position of topologically associating domain bondaries
* tf_[name].bed: Binding regions for various transcription factors.


### Your task
Investigate whether any of the transcription factors seem to have a preference to bind to the boundaries of topologically associating domains.
