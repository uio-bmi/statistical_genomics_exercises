# Exercise 6

1) Create a GSuite file with all open chromatin tracks using the tool “Create a GSuite from an integrated catalog of genomic datasets”. Choose DNA footprinting as method. You should get 57 tracks (choose broad peaks), keep all of them.
2) We will use the SNP file from the previous exercise, so make sure you have this file in your history.
3) Use the tool “Determine GSuite tracks coinciding with a target track”. Select the SNPs as the first file and the “Ready for analysis” file as the second. Avoid computing any p-values in the choice of analysis questions (since that will be slow).

PS: Choose to include “cell/tissue type” in the results table.
PS2: Select Forbes coefficient as similarity/distance measure (or something else if you want to)
