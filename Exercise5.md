# Exercise 5: Using the Genomic Hyperbrowser

1. Go to the Genomic HyperBrowser (https://hyperbrowser.uio.no). Register a new user if you want to keep what you do.
    * Click on the Advanced mode tab on the home screen to make sure you are in "Advanced mode". A menu will appear on the left.
2. We now want to work with SNPs and open chromatin from the whole genome. Download these two files:
    * [SNPs associated with Multiple Sclerosis]()
    * [Open chromatin for the cell we want to investigate]()
3. Upload these files to the genomic hyperbrowser by using clicking the upload icon in the top right of the left menu. *Get data* tool. You will find this tool in the left menu.
Set type to *bed* and genome to *hg19*.
    * After upload you should see two files appearing on the right. They will turn green when finished uploading.
4. Go to Statistical analysis of tracks -> Analyze genomic track, in the left menu 
    * As the first track select the SNPs by choosing *From history*.
    * As the second track, select the open chromatin regions
5. Try to figure out the rest for yourself from here, but choose "Located inside?" as hypothesis

PS: Select random seed 0 and *Quick and Rough" 

If time, re-run with different choices for null model.
